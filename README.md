# 🌍 AQI Forecasting Platform

An end-to-end **Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting and visualization platform** built using **Python, Machine Learning concepts, and Streamlit**.

This project focuses on **real-world ML deployment practices**, where model training is done locally and a lightweight inference/visualization layer is deployed on the cloud.

## 📌 Features
- 📊 Interactive AQI visualization dashboard  
- 🌆 City-wise AQI analysis  
- 📈 AQI trend forecasting  
- 🚦 AQI category classification (Good → Severe)  
- ⚡ Fast and cloud-optimized Streamlit deployment  
- 🧠 Machine-learning driven predictions (pre-computed)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Plotly**
- **Streamlit**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Historical AQI and environmental data collection  
2. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling  
3. Model training and evaluation (local environment)  
4. Saving predictions and preprocessing artifacts  
5. Cloud deployment using Streamlit (TensorFlow-free)

> ⚠️ Large datasets and trained model files are intentionally excluded from GitHub to comply with repository size limits and follow best practices.
